# GTEX-Cancer-Data-Analysis

A transcriptome-wide analysis was performed in order to delve deeper into the causes of Hashimotoâ€™s thyroiditis, 
the most common cause of hypothyroidism, and aggressive thyroid cancer. Using RNA-Seq data from Genotype-Tissue Expression 
(GTEx) and differential-expression-analysis tools, we were able to provide support for multiple recent findings, and 
introduce new genes, which could play a role in the development of both diseases.
